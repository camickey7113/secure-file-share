      <h2>1. Group Information</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Explain your planned development process, the strengths of your group, the
roles each member will play (and whether they will change), and how you plan to
enforce internal deadlines and ensure accountability. (See Task 1 for other
questions you should consider answering here.)</p>

<p>
  <h4>Organization</h4>
    Each member will be asked to review the following on a per meeting basis:
    <ul>
      <li>What was accomplished the previous week</li>
      <li>What will be accomplished in the next week</li>
      <li>Conflicts that were resolved</li>
      <li>Conflicts that are unresolved</li>
      <li>Integration needed in the coming week</li>
    </ul>
    The group will meet weekly on Wednesdays at 12-2PM unless stated otherwise.

  <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <p>
      Group has experience in Java, MySQL, and Maven. Members are familiar 
      with database management systems, and all have completed operating systems. All 
      members have experience in a professional environment doing group work.
    </p>

  <h4>Roles</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Authentication server - database setup and user management</li>
      <li>Resource server - basic access, elevated access and setup for each</li>
      <li>Client side integration - Switching between Authentication and Resource servers</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Anita: Resource Server- Elevated access</li>
      <li>Gab: Authentication Server</li>
      <li>Cole: Resource Server - Basic Access</li>
      <li>Cam: Client Side Integration</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>Deadline Enforcement and Accountability</h4>
    <p>
      Each group member will be informed ahead of time what their responsibilities 
      are for the week. If a group member thinks they will not be able to complete 
      their tasks by the deadline, they will communicate this with the group, who 
      will collectively decide how to manage the situation.
    </p>

  <h4>Dispute Management</h4>
    <p>
      Disputes will be attempted to be resolved among the group members, and will
        be taken to Professor Garrison if no resolution is found.
    </p>

    <section id="design">
      <h2>2. Design Proposal</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Overview the design of your system. Define more precisely the roles of the
authentication server and resource server, what type of resources are managed,
how accesses are determined and modified, what information is stored about
users, and the full set of operations that users have access to. (See Task 2 for
more details and requirements about your design.)</p>

<p>Remove these instructions and examples from your final submission.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>
    <section id="properties">
      <h2>3. Security Properties</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>This section should describe the properties that your group has identified as
being relevant to the application you are proposing. You should aim to find at
least 15–20 such properties. This section should be arranged as a bulleted list
of properties that <span class="emph">may</span> apply to a system like the one
you are designing. As noted in Task 3, it is possible that some of these
properties will be incompatible with one another.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some Property: Define the property</li>
  <li>Another Property: Define it, as well</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Remove these instructions and examples from your final submission.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>
    <section id="references">
      <h2>4. References</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>If your planned development process, system design, or security properties
are inspired by material from outside sources (e.g., books, papers, articles,
blog posts, or existing products), your sources should be cited here.</p>

<p>Remove these instructions and examples from your final submission.</p>
