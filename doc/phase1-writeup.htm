    <h4>Development Process</h4>
    Our development process will consist of assigning elements of the framework to different team members. On a weekly
    basis, we plan to meet to discuss progress, resolve any integration issues, and help one another with bugs. We will
    set deadlines for deliverables in order to reach project milestones through the semester.

    Each member will be asked to review the following on a per meeting basis:

    <ul>
      <li>What was accomplished the previous week</li>
      <li>What will be accomplished in the next week</li>
      <li>Conflicts that were resolved</li>
      <li>Conflicts that are unresolved</li>
      <li>Integration needed in the coming week</li>
    </ul>

    The group will meet weekly on Wednesdays at 12-2PM unless stated otherwise.

    <h4>Organization</h4>
    Each member will be asked to review the following on a per meeting basis:
    <ul>
      <li>What was accomplished the previous week</li>
      <li>What will be accomplished in the next week</li>
      <li>Conflicts that were resolved</li>
      <li>Conflicts that are unresolved</li>
      <li>Integration needed in the coming week</li>
    </ul>
    The group will meet weekly on Wednesdays at 12-2PM unless stated otherwise.

    <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <p>
      Group has experience in Java, MySQL, and Maven. Members are familiar
      with database management systems, and all have completed operating systems. All
      members have experience in a professional environment doing group work.
    </p>

    <h4>Roles</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Authentication server - database setup and user management</li>
      <li>Resource server - basic access, elevated access and setup for each</li>
      <li>Client side integration - Switching between Authentication and Resource servers</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Anita: Resource Server- Elevated access</li>
      <li>Gab: Authentication Server</li>
      <li>Cole: Resource Server - Basic Access</li>
      <li>Cam: Client Side Integration</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Deadline Enforcement and Accountability</h4>
    <p>
      Each group member will be informed ahead of time what their responsibilities
      are for the week. If a group member thinks they will not be able to complete
      their tasks by the deadline, they will communicate this with the group, who
      will collectively decide how to manage the situation.
    </p>

    <h4>Dispute Management</h4>
    <p>
      Disputes will be attempted to be resolved among the group members, and will
      be taken to Professor Garrison if no resolution is found.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Design Proposal</h2>
    <!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    Our group will be creating a file system that allows users to read, write, and execute files based on
    their permissions within the system. The authentication server will be used to determine or change a user’s
    permissions. Resource servers will be used to distribute the file capabilities.

    <h4>Authentication Server</h4>
    The authentication server will be where all users and user permissions are managed. In
    addition, the authentication server will generate a token to send to the client side in order to determine which
    type of access (basic or elevated) the user can initiate. In this scenario, read is basic access, and write/execute
    are elevated access. The authentication server should also be able to handle permission changes and new users.

    <h4>Resource Server</h4>
    The resource server will store files that the users can access and modify based on metadata in
    keys provided by the client. The metadata will determine whether users can make, read, modify, move and execute
    files. It will then contain the functionalities for these processes. In addition, it will validate the token
    presented by the client.

    <h4>Client Side Integration</h4>
    The Client Side is responsible for relaying information between the Authentication Server
    and the Resource Servers.

    <p>Programming Language: Java</p>
    
    <p>Potential Frameworks: MySQL, H2, Post-Gresql, Springboot/Spring Initializr, JWT, OAuth2</p>

    <h2>3. Security Properties</h2>
    <!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

    <p>This section should describe the properties that your group has identified as
      being relevant to the application you are proposing. You should aim to find at
      least 15–20 such properties. This section should be arranged as a bulleted list
      of properties that <span class="emph">may</span> apply to a system like the one
      you are designing. As noted in Task 3, it is possible that some of these
      properties will be incompatible with one another.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Some Property: Define the property</li>
      <li>Another Property: Define it, as well</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Remove these instructions and examples from your final submission.</p>

    <h2>4. References</h2>
    <!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

    <p>If your planned development process, system design, or security properties
      are inspired by material from outside sources (e.g., books, papers, articles,
      blog posts, or existing products), your sources should be cited here.</p>

    <p>Remove these instructions and examples from your final submission.</p>
