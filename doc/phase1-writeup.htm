      <h2>1. Group Information</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Explain your planned development process, the strengths of your group, the
roles each member will play (and whether they will change), and how you plan to
enforce internal deadlines and ensure accountability. (See Task 1 for other
questions you should consider answering here.)</p>

<p>Remove these instructions and examples from your final submission.</p>

    <section id="design">
      <h2>2. Design Proposal</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Overview the design of your system. Define more precisely the roles of the
authentication server and resource server, what type of resources are managed,
how accesses are determined and modified, what information is stored about
users, and the full set of operations that users have access to. (See Task 2 for
more details and requirements about your design.)</p>

<p>Remove these instructions and examples from your final submission.</p>

    <section id="properties">
      <h2>3. Security Properties</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>This section should describe the properties that your group has identified as
being relevant to the application you are proposing. You should aim to find at
least 15–20 such properties. This section should be arranged as a bulleted list
of properties that <span class="emph">may</span> apply to a system like the one
you are designing. As noted in Task 3, it is possible that some of these
properties will be incompatible with one another.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some Property: Define the property</li>
  <li>Another Property: Define it, as well</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Remove these instructions and examples from your final submission.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="references">
      <h2>4. References</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>If your planned development process, system design, or security properties
are inspired by material from outside sources (e.g., books, papers, articles,
blog posts, or existing products), your sources should be cited here.</p>

<p>Remove these instructions and examples from your final submission.</p>
